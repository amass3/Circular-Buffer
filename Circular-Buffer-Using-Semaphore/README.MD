prodcon_sem (part 2)
Author: Ayrton L. Massamba

For this part of the project, I mostly was inspired from the source below,
when it came to coding. The rest of my work did consist of reading the
documents or articles prodivided in the project instructions.

As to compile this part of the project. Please, do so by compile the test files
separately. There are no Makefile except the one meant to compile the kernel.

Example of compiling test_user_sem.c:

gcc -pthread test_user_sem.c -o test

The rest follows the sample effort and logic for the kernel test file as well.
Thank you for your hard work.
